          Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe
          the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML
          dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements
          should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized
          across Web browsers according to W3C specifications. Previously, the
          development of various parts of CSS specification was done
          synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest
          recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even
          CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now
          CSS without a version number.
        </p>
        <p>
          After CSS 2.1, the scope of the specification increased significantly
          and the progress on different CSS modules started to differ so much,
          that it became more effective to develop and release recommendations
          separately per module. Instead of versioning the CSS specification,
          W3C now periodically takes a snapshot of the latest stable state of
          the CSS specification and individual modules progress. CSS modules now
          have version numbers, or levels, such as CSS Color Module Level 5.

          Before CSS, nearly all presentational attributes of HTML documents
          were contained within the HTML markup. All font colors, background
          styles, element alignments, borders, and sizes had to be explicitly
          described, often repeatedly, within the HTML. CSS lets authors move
          much of that information to another file, the style sheet, resulting
          in considerably simpler HTML.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, headings (h1 elements), sub-headings (h2),
          sub-sub-headings (h3), etc., are defined structurally using HTML. In
          print and on the screen, choice of font, size, color and emphasis for
          these elements is presentational.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before CSS, document authors who wanted to assign such typographic
          characteristics to, say, all h2 headings had to repeat HTML
          presentational markup for each occurrence of that heading type. This
          made documents more complex, larger, and more error-prone and
          difficult to maintain. CSS allows the separation of presentation from
          structure. CSS can define color, font, text alignment, size, borders,
          spacing, layout and many other typographic characteristics, and can do
          so independently for on-screen and printed views. CSS also defines
          non-visual styles, such as reading speed and emphasis for aural text
          readers. The W3C has now deprecated the use of all presentational HTML
          markup.[15]
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, under pre-CSS HTML, a heading element defined with red
          text would be written as:
        </p>
        <!-- to make the css code doesn't work use this format  -->
        <code
          >&lt;h1&gt;&lt;font color="red">Chapter 1.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
        </code>

        <p>
          Using CSS, the same element can be coded using style properties
          instead of HTML presentational attributes:
        </p>
        <code> &lt;h1 style="color: red"&gt;Chapter 1.&lt;/h1&gt; </code>

        <p>
          The advantages of this may not be immediately clear but the power of
          CSS becomes more apparent when the style properties are placed in an
          internal style element or, even better, an external CSS file. For
          example, suppose the document contains the style element:
        </p>
        <code> &lt;style&gt; h1 { color: red; } &lt;/style&gt; </code>

        <p>
          All h1 elements in the document will then automatically become red
          without requiring any explicit code. If the author later wanted to
          make h1 elements blue instead, this could be done by changing the
          style element to:
        </p>
        <code> &lt;style&gt; h1 { color: blue; } &lt;/style&gt; </code>
        <p>
          rather than by laboriously going through the document and changing the
          color for each individual h1 element. The styles can also be placed in
          an external CSS file, as described below, and loaded using syntax
          similar to:
        </p>

        <code
          >&lt;link href="path/to/file.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"
          /&gt;
        </code>

        <p>
          This further decouples the styling from the HTML document and makes it
          possible to restyle multiple documents by simply editing a shared
          external CSS file.

          Our CSS Learning Area features multiple modules that teach CSS from
          the ground up — no previous knowledge required.
        </p>
        <h3>CSS first steps</h3>
        <p>
          CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages —
          for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your
          content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other
          decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your
          path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the
          syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to
          HTML.
        </p>
        <h3>CSS building blocks</h3>
        <p>
          This module carries on where CSS first steps left off — now you've
          gained familiarity with the language and its syntax, and got some
          basic experience with using it, it's time to dive a bit deeper. This
          module looks at the cascade and inheritance, all the selector types we
          have available, units, sizing, styling backgrounds and borders,
          debugging, and lots more. The aim here is to provide you with a
          toolkit for writing competent CSS and help you understand all the
          essential theory, before moving on to more specific disciplines like
          text styling and CSS layout.
        </p>
        <h3>CSS styling text</h3>
        <p>
          With the basics of the CSS language covered, the next CSS topic for
          you to concentrate on is styling text — one of the most common things
          you'll do with CSS. Here we look at text styling fundamentals,
          including setting font, boldness, italics, line and letter spacing,
          drop shadows, and other text features. We round off the module by
          looking at applying custom fonts to your page, and styling lists and
          links.
        </p>
        <h3>CSS layout</h3>
        <p>
          At this point we've already looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style
          text, and how to style and manipulate the boxes that your content sits
          inside. Now it's time to look at how to place your boxes in the right
          place in relation to the viewport, and to each other. We have covered
          the necessary prerequisites so we can now dive deep into CSS layout,
          looking at different display settings, modern layout tools like
          flexbox, CSS grid, and positioning, and some of the legacy techniques
          you might still want to know about.
        </p>
        <h3>Use CSS to solve common problems</h3>
        <p>
          This module provides links to sections of content explaining how to
          use CSS to solve common problems when creating a web page.
